# capitulation-euler
oh, fine, I GUESS I'll use JavaScript.

In 2021 I finally accepted that I needed to learn JavaScript. To soften the blow, I started by getting a better understanding of functional programming concepts by completing Euler problems using array functions.

I quit when I started spending more time researching mathematical theory than writing code.
